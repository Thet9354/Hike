Hike is an iOS app developed using Swift and SwiftUI. It offers a delightful user experience with a focus on complex card layouts, gradient animations, reusable components, and support for both light and dark modes. This README provides an overview of the app, its key features, and the learning objectives it offers.

## Key Features

### Complex Card Layouts
Hike showcases a complex card layout, which is a common design pattern in modern iOS apps. These cards display various types of content and information, making the app visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Gradient Animation
The app features smooth gradient animations that enhance the overall user experience. These animations not only look great but also provide valuable feedback to users.

### Reusable Components
Hike encourages code reusability by employing SwiftUI's reusable components. You'll find examples of how to create and use custom views, making your codebase more modular and maintainable.

### Light and Dark Mode
The app supports both light and dark modes, following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). Users can choose their preferred mode, ensuring a comfortable and visually pleasing experience.

### SwiftUI Containers
One of the primary learning objectives of this app is to familiarize developers with SwiftUI's container views. You'll discover how to use different layout containers such as `HStack`, `VStack`, and `ZStack` to arrange your UI elements effectively.

### Alternate App Icons
Hike goes beyond the basics by demonstrating how to implement alternate app icons. Users can customize their app's icon to match their style, providing a personalized touch to the app.

### SF Symbols Integration
The app leverages Apple's SF Symbols, a library of icons designed to seamlessly integrate with Apple platforms. You'll learn how to incorporate these symbols into your app for a consistent and polished look.
